# Abstract

There are many techniques for the declarative specification of user interfaces, but it is not clear how to study their similarities and differences. The category-theoretic notion of a comonad captures some essential aspects of these specification techniques. The approach presented here generalizes several known techniques, but perhaps more interestingly, it also generates several new comonads as we search for ways to represent existing user interfaces.
