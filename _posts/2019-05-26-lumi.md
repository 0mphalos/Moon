# Abstract
At Lumi, we've spent the last 18 months or so incrementally replacing our entire stack with purely functional programming languages - specifically Haskell and PureScript. I'll share some stories about how we got there from a very different stack in small steps. I'll also show some of the open source work we've been releasing lately.
