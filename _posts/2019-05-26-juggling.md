# Abstract
In this talk, I'll show how we can use basic Haskell as a tool to help us learn another skill - juggling! I'll demonstrate the basic facts about juggling that you need to understand the code, and then we'll write some Haskell to help us understand more about juggling, and find some new, interesting juggling tricks.
