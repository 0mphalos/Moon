# Abstract

The abstract-machine nature of Ethereum has a highly unstructured, rigid storage model that is not convenient for using abstraction in its smart contracts.  This is partially addressed by higher-level contract languages, Solidity being the most common, that do support some basic structured types.  Supposing that a real language such as Haskell could be used to write contracts, I will illustrate how its flexible concept of execution environment (i.e. monads) facilitates a fluent style of contract programming that can benefit from its rich type system.
