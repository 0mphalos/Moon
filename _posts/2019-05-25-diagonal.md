# Abstract

In my presentation I would like to review Algorithm W of the Hindleyâ€“Milner type system, the type inference and type checking algorithm that powers the PureScript and Haskell compiler's ability to prove a program's type correctness. I would like to review and explain the rules of Algorithm W, unification, and also review the proofs currently used to show completeness and soundness, but offer a counter proof that shows Algorithm W isn't necessarily complete. Specifically I would like to show that one can use diagonalization to show that some programs are undecidable when using Algorithm W.
