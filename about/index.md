# Program

Please join us for a weekend of Haskell/Purescript lectures and hacking in the spirit of BayHac (but in LA!). We are looking for speakers to do 30-45minute presentations on any topics related to Haskell and Purescript. We are also looking for open source maintainers who would like to present their Haskell/Purescript for contributions during our open hacking sessions.

If you are interested in giving a talk, please send your proposal using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxroAXDfjO8IQJjpU2A9YWhcu5qboKVIzn37xcvHF5dEcopg/viewform)
