# Introduction

The purpose of this gathering is to explore common perspectives of category theory within functional programming frameworks and applications.

# Where and when

[NAVEL](https://goo.gl/maps/EmtKVixQHpN2) @ 1611 S Hope st,
Los Angeles, 90015 CA
26-27 May 2018

Parking will be available. Lunch will be offered to participants for free. Registration required. Seats are limited. Please only RVSP if you are certain you can make it. 

# Program

The idea is to start each day with a longer talk that sets the theme for the day. The afternoon then allows general open hacking sessions on that theme, occasionally interrupted by a 15-20min lightning talk. If possible, weâ€™d end each day with brief presentations / discussions about the work done.

# Schedule

The schedule for the weekend is as follows
