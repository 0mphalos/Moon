# Introduction

The purpose of this gathering is to explore common perspectives of category theory within functional programming frameworks and applications. We're also going to look at recent applications using purescript for writing full-stack blockchain applications.

# Where and when

[NAVEL](https://goo.gl/maps/EmtKVixQHpN2)<br>
1611 S Hope st<br>
Los Angeles, 90015 CA<br>
26-27 May 2018

Parking will be available. Lunch will be offered to participants for free. Registration required. Seats are limited. Please only RVSP if you are certain you can make it. 

# Program

The idea is to start each day with a longer talk that sets the theme for the day. The afternoon then allows general open hacking sessions and pair-programming on that theme, occasionally interrupted by 15-20min lightning talks. If possible, weâ€™d end each day with brief presentations / discussions about the work done.

If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please reach out: kristoffer@foam.space
