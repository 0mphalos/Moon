# Program

The idea is to start each day with a longer talk that sets the theme for the day. The afternoon then allows general open hacking sessions and pair-programming on that theme, occasionally interrupted by 15-20min lightning talks. If possible, weâ€™d end each day with brief presentations / discussions about the work done.

If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please reach out: kristoffer@foam.space
